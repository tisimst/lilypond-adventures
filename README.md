LilyPond Adventures
===================

This is my music engraving playground for LilyPond, and as such, I cannot 
guarantee that anything works perfectly or even partially. 

Anything I put here is released under the GNU Public License (unless otherwise 
noted in the file), so feel free to use, copy, change and update as you desire. 

If you like my work, drop me a line! I'd love to engrave something for you or 
give you tips to help you get going in your own scores.

I can be contacted at tisimst dot lilypond at gmail dot com.
